# Important questions to ask

> Tuesday, 26 May 2020

## Why did you start your company?

If you can get to the heart of why they went into business, you’ll be able to create a logo that feels more genuine to that original mission.

## What does your company do?

Identifying this is important as you don’t want to design something that looks great, but is all wrong for the market they’re working in.

## Who do you serve?

While the client’s opinion of the logo matters, you need to focus on building something that looks good from the eyes of their audience.

## Why do customers choose your company over others?

Their unique selling proposition will help you differentiate their logo from the competitors’ designs.

## Who are your top 3 competitors? How do you feel about their logos?

This is a great question to ask if you want to get a raw, emotional response as opposed to the more buttoned-up responses the other questions may elicit.

## What are your company’s values?

A good way to identify a unique edge for a brand is by looking at what they prioritize. Integrity? Customer commitment? Green initiatives?

## How would you describe the company’s personality in 3 words?

You’ll be able to get a sense for the company’s “voice” when you talk to the business owner. But it’s always good to see how they describe it, too.

## Do you have a slogan?

You won’t necessarily build the words into the logo (especially since there’s no room for it on mobile). But a slogan can help inform the design.

## Where do you see your company in 5 years?

Rather than design something that looks good for the company on Day 1, you should create a logo that captures who they plan to be in the near future.

## Who are your heroes and why?

Take a gander at the companies they look up to. Even if they don’t have a clear vision for their company yet, who their heroes are will give you a clue as to where they’re heading.
