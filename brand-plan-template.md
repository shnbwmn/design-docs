#### Brainstorm brand message (*mindmap*)

> Visualise information from (self-)interview.   
> Project in centre, decide on categories, space around centre, connect to centre.   
> Write thoughts and answers around each question. Vary size to indicate relative importance.   
> Connect each answer to its question, pick out key information.   
> Do something else and come back next day to review and revise.

* **Who are we here for?**
* **What is our personality?**

> Qualitative data: people's thoughts and opinions.   
> Quantitative data: numerical and statistical data.

* Primary research
    * surveys (keep it short, conduct on different days and times)
    * interviews
    * focus groups
    * data already collected from project
* Secondary research
    * existing reports and studies
    * data on internet
    * articles from newspapers, magazines or journals

> Good start for secondary research is official demographic data in your area of interest.

> Visualise this data (eg, survey) in the form of graphs and charts.   
> Use a spreadsheet program, use appropriate visual style, eg bar graph.   
> Colour-code the results, using same colours for most and least popular answers.   
> Analyse the data to find your audiences. List identified target audiences and their qualities. 

#### Audits

> Audit your existing style of communication (how you talk and look, eg verbal and visual style).

* Look at every medium in which you promote yourself, eg website, blog, social media pages, business cards, flyers, brochures, etc.
* Consider verbal style:
    * Project/brand name
    * Do you have a strapline?
    * How do you describe yourself (brand story)?
    * Tone of voice (are your words chatty, formal, neutral, etc)?
* Consider visual style:
    * Current logo
    * Project's fonts
    * Colour palette
    * Imagery - photos and illustrations
    * Way these visuals are combined - layout
* Are elements consistent wherever you promote yourself?

    * What needs to change?

* Map competitors and yourself.
    * Are you happy there?
    * Look for new place in the sector?
    * Look at gaps in the market that you could fill.

#### Brand expansion
> Think about future requirements and flexibility of your brand.   
> Come up with ideas that connect naturally to your main project.   

* Stay true to brand personality.
* Don't change too many brand elements.
* Keep verbal and visual brand in mind.

> Slot new ideas into the appropriate segment.

### Verbal Brand

#### Summary Line / Descriptor

> Use frequently in visual communications - could also be used as strapline.

#### Brand Name
> Find a unique and memorable name. make sure it differs from other names in your sector.

#### Brand Values / Personality
> Use keywords or short phrases. For you to refer to, rather than with audience.

#### Tone of Voice
> Use to communicate consistently with audience. Also influences visual brand.   
> Eg, chatty tone might call for informal, casual font.

#### Brand Story
> What you want audience to know about your project. Aim for two or three paragraphs.

### Development

#### Feedback and refinement

* Seek feedback from colleagues, potential customers, etc and refine accordingly.

#### Creation of brand assets

* Once brand elements fixed, create **toolkit of assets** (logo, colour palettes, imagery, brand guidelines).
* Use toolkit to create **materials for launch** (eg, website, product labels, brochures, flyers).
    * Format
    * White space
    * Structure
    * Hierarchy (type, colour, scale)
    * Composition (grids, alignment, grouping, harmony, balance)
    * Wireframes
